# Contributing to Hermes Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hermes Protocol.

This project is an open, living laboratory for human development.  
Because it deals with attention, emotion, cognition, and consciousness, **care, clarity, and responsibility are required**.

This document explains how to contribute safely and constructively.

---

## Core Expectations

All contributors agree to the following principles:

- Safety takes precedence over novelty
- Measurement matters more than belief
- Transparency beats authority
- No one is above critique
- No contribution is required to be correct — only honest

If these principles do not align with your intentions, this project may not be a good fit.

## What You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following forms:

### 1. Protocols
New practices that improve:
- Regulation
- Stability
- Performance
- Awareness

All protocols **must** use the official template:
protocols/template_protocol.md


---

### 2. Experiments & Case Reports
Documented self-experiments or observations, including:
- Baseline measurements
- Weekly metrics
- Outcomes (positive, neutral, or negative)

Honest failures are as valuable as successes.

---

### 3. Documentation Improvements
- Clarifying language
- Improving structure
- Correcting errors
- Adding references

Clear writing improves safety.

---

### 4. Measurement Framework Improvements
Suggestions for:
- Better metrics
- Simpler tracking
- Clearer interpretation

Measurement must remain accessible and non-invasive.

---

## What We Do NOT Accept

The following contributions will not be accepted:

- Claims of guaranteed results
- Claims of supernatural powers
- Hidden or exclusive knowledge
- Guru-style authority language
- Protocols that skip Phase 1
- Practices involving extreme deprivation or intensity
- Anything that violates `docs/02_safety.md`

Hermes Protocol is not a belief system.

---

## Safety Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

All contributions involving practices **must** include:

- Clear purpose
- Explicit risks and contraindications
- Stop conditions
- Measurement metrics

If safety is unclear, the contribution will be rejected or revised.

Clarity improves review speed.

---

## Review Process

All pull requests are reviewed for:

1. Safety
2. Measurement clarity
3. Phase alignment
4. Reproducibility

Review feedback is part of the process.

Revisions are normal.

---

## Tone & Language Guidelines

Use:
- Clear, grounded language
- Probabilistic phrasing (“may,” “tends to,” “observed”)
- First-person experience when relevant

Avoid:
- Absolutes (“always,” “guaranteed”)
- Evangelical or mystical framing
- Identity-based superiority (“awakened,” “higher level”)

Language shapes outcomes.

---

## Reporting Harm or Concerns

If you encounter:
- Adverse effects
- Psychological destabilization
- Unsafe recommendations

Open an issue immediately or contact the maintainers.

Silence about harm is unacceptable.

---

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project’s open-source license.

This ensures the protocol remains public and accessible.

---

## Final Note

Hermes Protocol is an experiment in **collective responsibility**.

We are not here to be impressive.  
We are here to be careful, curious, and honest.

Thank you for helping build something that can last.
