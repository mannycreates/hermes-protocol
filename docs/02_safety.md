Hermes Protocol — Safety Charter v0.1
Purpose of This Charter

Hermes Protocol exists to explore human development safely, responsibly, and transparently.

Because this project involves attention, emotion, cognition, and consciousness, it carries real psychological risk if practiced carelessly.

This charter defines the non-negotiable safety boundaries of the Hermes Protocol.

No protocol, experiment, or contribution is valid if it violates these principles.
Core Safety Principle

Human stability is always more important than insight, performance, or altered experience.

No breakthrough is worth psychological harm.
What Hermes Protocol Is Not

This project does not replace:

    Medical care

    Psychiatric care

    Psychological therapy

    Emergency services

Hermes Protocol is an educational and experimental framework only.

All practices are voluntary and self-directed.
Required Conditions for Participation

Participants should meet all of the following before engaging in protocols beyond basic regulation practices:

    Able to maintain daily functioning (work, relationships, hygiene, sleep)

    Not currently in acute psychological crisis

    Not experiencing untreated severe anxiety, depression, psychosis, or mania

    Not using Hermes Protocol as a substitute for professional care

If these conditions are not met, participation should be limited to Phase 1: Regulation & Stability practices only.
Hard Stop Conditions

Any participant must immediately pause all protocols and return to stabilization practices if they experience:

    Persistent anxiety or panic

    Insomnia lasting more than 48 hours

    Depersonalization or derealization

    Obsessive rumination or loss of reality testing

    Paranoia, grandiosity, or perceptual distortions

    Withdrawal from work, relationships, or daily responsibilities

These are signals of nervous system overload, not progress.
No Coercion Principle

Hermes Protocol forbids:

    Pressure to continue practices

    Claims of spiritual superiority

    Shaming for stopping or questioning methods

    Hierarchies based on “level” or “awakening”

Participants must always feel free to slow down, pause, or leave.
Gradualism Rule

All development must follow this order:

    Regulation

    Stability

    Performance

    Exploration

Skipping stages increases risk of psychological destabilization.

Intensity without stability is not growth — it is overload.
No Absolute Claims

Hermes Protocol forbids:

    Claims of guaranteed outcomes

    Claims of hidden ultimate truths

    Claims of exclusive knowledge

    Claims of supernatural powers

All findings must remain provisional and revisable.
Measurement Before Meaning

Subjective experiences must not be treated as proof of truth.

All insights must be balanced with:

    Sleep quality

    Emotional stability

    Daily functioning

    Relationship health

    Long-term consistency

If life degrades, the protocol is failing.
Contraindicated Practices

Hermes Protocol will not include:

    Extreme sleep deprivation

    Prolonged fasting

    Sensory deprivation

    Breath-holding contests

    High-dose psychedelic advocacy

    Induction of fear-based altered states

Exploration must remain within safe physiological limits.
Mental Health Priority

If a participant has a history of:

    Bipolar disorder

    Psychotic disorders

    Severe dissociation

    Recent trauma

They should consult a licensed professional before participating in any advanced protocols.
Ethical Boundary

Hermes Protocol exists to strengthen human agency, not replace it.

Any method that weakens autonomy, critical thinking, or self-trust violates this charter.
Community Responsibility

Contributors must:

    Flag potential risks in all protocols

    Include contraindications

    Report adverse outcomes

    Update methods when harm is detected

Silence about harm is unacceptable.
Versioning

This charter will evolve as evidence improves.

Safety rules may become stricter, not looser.

This is version 0.1.
What This Document Does

This charter protects:

    Participants

    Contributors

    The integrity of the project

    The future of Hermes Protocol

Without safety, there is no legitimacy.

When you commit this, Hermes Protocol becomes something rare:

An ambitious project that is also ethically grounded.
