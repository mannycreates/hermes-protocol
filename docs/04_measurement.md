# Hermes Protocol — Measurement Baseline v0.1

## Why Measurement Exists

Hermes Protocol is not built on belief.

It is built on observation.

Human development without measurement becomes storytelling.  
Measurement without perfection is still better than none.

We measure not to control humans, but to remain honest about outcomes.

---

## Core Principle

**If overall life quality is not improving, the protocol is failing — regardless of how meaningful or intense experiences feel.**

Insight without functional improvement is not progress.

---

## What We Measure

Hermes Protocol uses a **minimum viable measurement set**.

These metrics are not meant to capture everything.  
They exist to detect **directional change** and **early warning signs**.

---

## Weekly Baseline Metrics (Required)

Every participant should record the following once per week:

| Metric | Scale |
|------|------|
| Sleep Quality | 1–10 |
| Energy Level | 1–10 |
| Mood Stability | 1–10 |
| Anxiety / Stress | 1–10 |
| Focus / Mental Clarity | 1–10 |
| Life Functioning | 1–10 |

**Life Functioning includes:**
- Ability to work or study
- Quality of relationships
- Daily responsibilities
- Hygiene, nutrition, and self-care

A declining Life Functioning score overrides all other metrics.

---

## Daily Light Metrics (Optional)

For participants who want higher resolution tracking:

| Metric | Format |
|------|------|
| Sleep Hours | Numeric |
| Mental Clarity | 1–10 |
| Emotional Balance | 1–10 |
| Cognitive Load | 1–10 |

These metrics help identify slow drift before destabilization occurs.

---

## Stability Thresholds

Before advancing beyond **Phase 1: Regulation & Stability**, participants should demonstrate:

- No declining trend over 3–4 consecutive weeks
- No persistent scores below 5 in any core metric
- Stable sleep and daily functioning

Exploration without stability increases risk.

---

## Protocol-Specific Metrics

Each protocol must define at least **one measurable outcome**.

Examples:

| Protocol Type | Example Metric |
|-------------|--------------|
| Focus training | Minutes of deep work |
| Sleep protocol | Sleep onset latency |
| Emotional regulation | Stress recovery time |
| Creativity | Creative sessions per week |
| Dreamwork | Dream recall frequency |

Protocols without defined metrics are considered incomplete.

---

## Subjective Experience Guidelines

Subjective experiences may be recorded, but:

- They do not override baseline metrics
- They do not prove truth claims
- They must be evaluated across time, not moments

Intense or meaningful experiences can coexist with declining life quality — this is a failure condition.

---

## Measurement Before Meaning

Hermes Protocol reverses the usual order:

Most systems follow:
> Experience → Meaning → Assumption of progress

Hermes Protocol follows:
> Measurement → Pattern → Interpretation

Meaning follows evidence, not the other way around.

---

## Data Simplicity Rule

We prioritize:
- Consistency over precision
- Few metrics over many
- Trends over isolated data points

Human systems are complex.  
We measure direction, not perfection.

---

## Required Reporting for Experiments

All experiments must include:

- Baseline measurements (before)
- Weekly measurements (during)
- Final measurements (after)
- Any negative side effects
- Whether overall life functioning improved, declined, or stayed neutral

Results without context are not considered valid.

---

## When Measurement Overrides Curiosity

If any protocol results in:
- Declining sleep
- Emotional instability
- Reduced daily functioning

The protocol must be paused — regardless of fascination, novelty, or perceived insight.

Progress is defined by sustainability, not intensity.

---

## Versioning

This measurement framework will evolve.

We begin simple and refine over time.

This is version 0.1.

---

## Purpose of This Document

This baseline exists to keep Hermes Protocol:

- Grounded
- Honest
- Self-correcting
- Scientifically respectable

Without measurement, we drift into mythology.  
With measurement, we remain explorers.
