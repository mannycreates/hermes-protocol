# Hermes Protocol — Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Hermes Protocol is an open, collaborative project dedicated to responsible exploration of human development.

We are committed to creating an environment that is:
- Safe
- Respectful
- Inclusive
- Grounded in humility and evidence

Participation in this project requires care — both for oneself and for others.

---

## Core Values

All participants, contributors, and maintainers agree to uphold the following values:

- **Safety first** — human wellbeing overrides curiosity or ambition
- **Humility** — no one has final answers
- **Honesty** — report failures as openly as successes
- **Respect** — toward people, boundaries, and lived experience
- **Responsibility** — language and actions have real effects

---

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

- Communicate with clarity and kindness
- Respect differing perspectives and experiences
- Accept constructive feedback without defensiveness
- Acknowledge uncertainty and limits of knowledge
- Prioritize safety when discussing practices or outcomes
- Defer to evidence and lived impact over ideology

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Harassment, intimidation, or personal attacks
- Discrimination or exclusion based on identity or belief
- Claims of spiritual, intellectual, or moral superiority
- Guru-style authority or dependency dynamics
- Encouraging unsafe, extreme, or destabilizing practices
- Dismissing harm reports or minimizing others’ experiences
- Using the project to recruit for external belief systems

Hermes Protocol is not a platform for evangelism.

---

## Power & Authority Boundaries

No contributor, including maintainers, holds special authority over others’ inner lives.

We explicitly reject:
- Hierarchies of “awakening” or “level”
- Pressure to continue participation
- Claims of exclusive insight or access

Agency and autonomy are non-negotiable.

---

## Language Guidelines

Because language shapes perception, we ask contributors to:

Use:
- Clear, grounded, probabilistic language
- “May,” “tends to,” “observed,” “in this context”
- First-person framing for subjective experiences

Avoid:
- Absolutes (“always,” “guaranteed,” “proven truth”)
- Dehumanizing or dismissive language
- Metaphors that imply inevitability or destiny

---

## Reporting Concerns

If you experience or observe behavior that violates this code:

- Open a GitHub Issue, **or**
- Contact the project maintainers directly (if listed)

All reports will be taken seriously and reviewed promptly.

Retaliation against individuals who raise concerns is unacceptable.

---

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take any action deemed appropriate, including:

- Requesting changes or clarification
- Removing content
- Closing issues or pull requests
- Temporarily or permanently restricting participation

Enforcement decisions prioritize safety and integrity over popularity.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- GitHub repositories
- Issues and pull requests
- Discussions and documentation
- Any community spaces officially associated with Hermes Protocol

---

## A Final Note

Hermes Protocol exists to help humans become **more coherent**, not more divided.

Curiosity without care becomes harm.  
Care without curiosity becomes stagnation.

We commit to holding both.

This Code of Conduct may evolve as the project grows.
