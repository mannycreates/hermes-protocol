- Prior art or inspirations (optional)

This section explains *why*, not *belief*.

---

## Required Stability Level

Before attempting this protocol, participants must meet:

- ☐ Stable sleep
- ☐ Stable daily functioning
- ☐ No acute psychological distress

If advanced, specify additional requirements.

---

## Time Commitment

1. Step one  
2. Step two  
3. Step three  

Instructions should be simple enough to follow without interpretation.

---

## Measurement Metrics

At least **one measurable outcome** is required.

### Primary Metric
What is the main variable being tracked?

Example:
- Minutes of uninterrupted focus
- Sleep onset latency
- Stress recovery time

### Secondary Metrics (Optional)
- Energy
- Mood
- Focus
- Life functioning

Metrics must align with `docs/04_measurement.md`.

---

## Expected Outcomes

What *may* improve if the protocol works?

Avoid guarantees.

Frame outcomes probabilistically.

---

## Potential Risks & Contraindications

This section is mandatory.

Include:
- Who should NOT attempt this protocol

- Emotional instability
- Decline in daily functioning
- Obsessive or compulsive behavior

Reference `docs/02_safety.md`.

---

## Integration Notes

How should participants integrate insights or results into daily life?

Examples:
- Journaling prompts
- Reflection questions
- Cool-down practices

Integration is required for completion.
