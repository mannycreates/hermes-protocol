# Hermes Protocol — Sleep Anchor (Fixed Wake Time) v0.1

## Protocol Version
v0.1

---

## Phase Alignment
**Phase 1 — Regulation & Stability**

This protocol supports all higher-level practices.

---

## Purpose

To stabilize circadian rhythm, improve sleep quality, and increase baseline energy and emotional regulation.

This protocol prioritizes **consistency over duration**.

---

## Background / Rationale

Research in circadian biology shows that a consistent wake time is one of the strongest regulators of sleep quality, mood stability, and cognitive performance.

Attempting to optimize sleep duration or sleep hacks without circadian stability often worsens outcomes.

This protocol establishes a biological anchor point.

---

## Required Stability Level

Minimum requirements:
- ☐ Able to wake independently (alarm or natural)
- ☐ No acute sleep deprivation
- ☐ No shift work or rotating schedules

If these conditions are not met, adapt cautiously or postpone.

---

## Time Commitment

- Wake time: **Same time every day**
- Tolerance window: ±15 minutes
- Recommended duration: **14 days minimum**

Bedtime is *not* fixed.

---

## Materials / Environment

- Alarm (phone or clock)
- Access to morning light (preferred but optional)
- Journal or notes app (optional)

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Choose a **realistic wake time** you can maintain every day.
2. Wake at this time **regardless of sleep duration**.
3. Upon waking:
   - Sit up
   - Open curtains or expose eyes to light
4. Avoid returning to bed.
5. Do not attempt to “fix” sleep with naps longer than 30 minutes.
6. Go to bed when genuinely sleepy.

Do not force sleep.

## Measurement Metrics

### Primary Metric
- **Sleep Quality** (1–10, weekly)

### Secondary Metrics
- Energy Level (1–10)
- Mood Stability (1–10)
- Sleep Hours (numeric)

Improvement may take several days.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Possible outcomes include:
- Improved sleep onset
- More consistent energy levels
- Reduced morning grogginess
- Improved emotional regulation

Temporary fatigue during adjustment is normal.

---

## Potential Risks & Contraindications

- Short-term tiredness
- Mild irritability during first few days

This protocol may not be appropriate for:
- Shift workers
- New parents
- Individuals with diagnosed sleep disorders (consult professional)

---

## Stop Conditions

Pause or modify if:
- Sleep quality worsens after 7 days
- Daytime functioning declines
- Persistent exhaustion occurs

Return to baseline stabilization practices.

---

## Integration Notes

Recommended reflection (weekly):
> “How does consistency affect my mood and energy?”

Avoid daily analysis.
