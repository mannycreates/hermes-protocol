# Hermes Protocol — Phase 1: Regulation & Stability

Phase 1 is the foundation of the Hermes Protocol.

Its purpose is to establish **baseline human stability** before any attempt at performance optimization or consciousness exploration.

No protocol beyond Phase 1 should be attempted without completing this phase.

---

## Why Phase 1 Exists

Most personal development systems fail because they start at the wrong layer.

They attempt:
- Insight without regulation
- Performance without sleep
- Exploration without stability

Phase 1 corrects this.

**Stability is not optional.  
Stability is access.**

---

## Phase 1 Objectives

Phase 1 is designed to:

- Improve nervous system regulation
- Stabilize sleep and energy
- Increase self-awareness without interference
- Reduce baseline stress and reactivity
- Establish reliable measurement habits

This phase prioritizes **safety, consistency, and coherence** over intensity or novelty.

---

## Who Phase 1 Is For

Phase 1 is appropriate for:

- New participants
- Individuals returning from burnout or stress
- Anyone unsure of their current stability level
- Anyone starting Hermes Protocol for the first time

If unsure where to begin, begin here.

## Phase 1 Protocol Stack

Phase 1 consists of three low-risk, high-impact protocols.

They are designed to be used together.

---

### 1. Grounded Check-In (5×5)

**Purpose:**  
Build awareness of internal state without attempting to change it.

**Core Function:**  
Orientation and early detection of overload.

**File:**  
`grounded_checkin_5x5.md`

**Frequency:**  
Once daily (5 minutes)

---

### 2. Sleep Anchor (Fixed Wake Time)

**Purpose:**  
Stabilize circadian rhythm and baseline energy.

**Core Function:**  
Biological regulation through consistency.

**File:**  
`sleep_anchor_fixed_wake.md`

**Frequency:**  
Daily (fixed wake time)

---

### 3. Gentle Breath Regulation (Extended Exhale)

**Purpose:**  
Reduce stress and support nervous system downregulation.

**Core Function:**  
Physiological calming without intensity.

**File:**  
`gentle_breath_regulation_exhale.md`

**Frequency:**  
1–3 short sessions per day

---

## Recommended Phase 1 Schedule

Phase 1 should be practiced for a **minimum of 14 days**.

Suggested daily structure:

- Morning:
  - Wake at fixed time (Sleep Anchor)
  - Optional gentle breath regulation

- Midday or Evening:
  - Grounded Check-In (5×5)

- As Needed:
  - Gentle breath regulation during stress

Do not add new protocols during this phase.

---

## Measurement Requirements

All Phase 1 participants should track:

**Weekly (Required):**
- Sleep Quality
- Energy Level
- Mood Stability
- Anxiety / Stress
- Focus / Mental Clarity
- Life Functioning

Refer to:
`docs/04_measurement.md`

If any metric declines consistently, pause and reassess.

---

## Completion Criteria

Phase 1 is considered complete when:

- No declining trends are observed over 3–4 weeks
- Sleep and daily functioning are stable
- Stress and reactivity are manageable
- Protocols feel sustainable, not effortful

There is no benefit to rushing.

---

## What Comes After Phase 1

Only after completing Phase 1 should participants consider:

- **Phase 2 — Performance**
- **Phase 3 — Consciousness Exploration**

Skipping Phase 1 increases risk and reduces long-term benefit.

---

## Core Rule of Hermes Protocol

> Stability earns access.

Phase 1 exists to protect participants, contributors, and the integrity of the system.
