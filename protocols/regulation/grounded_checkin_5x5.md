# Hermes Protocol — Grounded Check-In (5×5) v0.1

## Protocol Version
v0.1

---

## Phase Alignment
**Phase 1 — Regulation & Stability**

This protocol is a prerequisite for all higher-intensity practices.

---

## Purpose

To establish baseline nervous system regulation, self-awareness, and daily coherence.

This protocol trains the capacity to *notice* internal state without attempting to change it.

---

## Background / Rationale

Many forms of psychological instability arise not from extreme experiences, but from lack of consistent self-monitoring.

This protocol is inspired by:
- Interoceptive awareness research
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
- Cognitive behavioral check-in practices

The goal is not insight, catharsis, or optimization — only **orientation**.

---

## Required Stability Level

Minimum requirements:
- ☐ Able to maintain daily functioning
- ☐ No acute psychological crisis
- ☐ Stable sleep (or actively stabilizing)

This protocol is safe for most participants.

---

## Time Commitment

- Time per session: **5 minutes**
- Frequency: **Once per day**
- Recommended duration: **14 days minimum**

Consistency matters more than duration.

---

## Materials / Environment

- Quiet or semi-quiet space
- Journal or notes app (optional)
- Timer (optional)

No special posture or environment required.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Pause whatever you are doing.
2. Sit or stand comfortably.
3. Take **one natural breath** (do not control it).
4. Mentally note the following five items:

   - **Body:** physical sensations present
   - **Emotion:** dominant emotional tone
   - **Mind:** clarity vs. noise
   - **Energy:** low / medium / high
   - **Environment:** what is happening around you

5. Do **not** attempt to fix, judge, or change anything.
6. If journaling, write **one sentence per item** (optional).
7. End the check-in and continue your day.

Total time should not exceed five minutes.

## Measurement Metrics

### Primary Metric
- **Life Functioning** (1–10, weekly)

### Secondary Metrics (Optional)
- Mood Stability (1–10)
- Mental Clarity (1–10)
- Energy Level (1–10)

This protocol should never reduce baseline metrics.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Possible outcomes include:
- Increased emotional awareness
- Earlier detection of stress or overload
- Improved self-regulation over time
- Greater sense of internal coherence

No immediate effects are required.

---

## Potential Risks & Contraindications

Low risk.

However, participants with:
- Severe anxiety
- Trauma history
- Dissociative tendencies

Should keep journaling minimal and stop if distress increases.

---

## Stop Conditions

Immediately pause the protocol if:
- Anxiety increases
- Rumination intensifies
- Sleep worsens
- Daily functioning declines

Return to baseline regulation practices.

---

## Integration Notes

This protocol integrates naturally into daily life.

Recommended reflection (optional):
> “What patterns am I noticing over time?”

Do not analyze patterns daily — review weekly at most.
