# Hermes Protocol — Gentle Breath Regulation (Extended Exhale) v0.1

## Protocol Version
v0.1

---

## Phase Alignment
**Phase 1 — Regulation & Stability**

This protocol supports nervous system downregulation and emotional stability.

---

## Purpose

To reduce baseline stress, calm the nervous system, and improve emotional regulation using gentle breath mechanics.

This protocol trains **downregulation**, not stimulation.

---

## Background / Rationale

Slow breathing with an extended exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system and reduces physiological arousal.

This protocol is influenced by:
- Respiratory sinus arrhythmia research
- Clinical anxiety regulation techniques
- Stress recovery practices used in medical and therapeutic contexts

No breath retention or hyperventilation is used.

---

## Required Stability Level

Minimum requirements:
- ☐ Able to breathe comfortably through the nose or mouth
- ☐ No acute respiratory distress
- ☐ No panic disorder triggered by breath awareness

This protocol is low-risk when performed gently.

---

## Time Commitment

- Time per session: **2–5 minutes**
- Frequency: **1–3 times per day**
- Recommended duration: **14 days minimum**

Short and frequent is preferred.

---

## Materials / Environment

- Quiet or semi-quiet space
- Comfortable seated or standing posture
- Timer (optional)

No special posture required.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Option A — Physiological Sigh (1–3 cycles)

1. Inhale gently through the nose.
2. Without exhaling, take a second short inhale to fully fill the lungs.
3. Exhale slowly through the mouth.
4. Pause briefly.
5. Repeat up to **3 cycles** only.

Stop immediately if dizziness occurs.

---

### Option B — Extended Exhale Breathing (Primary Method)

1. Inhale naturally through the nose for **~4 seconds**.
2. Exhale slowly through the mouth or nose for **~6–8 seconds**.
3. Keep the breath soft and unforced.
4. Repeat for **2–5 minutes**.

The exhale should always be longer than the inhale.

---

## Measurement Metrics

### Primary Metric
- **Anxiety / Stress** (1–10, weekly)

### Secondary Metrics
- Mood Stability (1–10)
- Sleep Quality (1–10)
- Energy Level (1–10)

This protocol should never worsen baseline metrics.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Possible outcomes include:
- Reduced stress reactivity
- Faster emotional recovery
- Improved calm and clarity
- Increased awareness of bodily state

Effects may be subtle and cumulative.

---

## Potential Risks & Contraindications

Low risk.

However, participants with:
- Panic disorder
- Severe respiratory conditions
- Trauma linked to breath awareness

Should proceed cautiously and stop if distress increases.

---

## Stop Conditions

Immediately pause if:
- Dizziness occurs
- Anxiety increases
- Breath becomes forced or uncomfortable
- Emotional distress intensifies

Return to natural breathing.

---

## Integration Notes

Recommended use cases:
- Upon waking
- During stress
- Before sleep
- After emotionally activating situations

This protocol should feel calming, not effortful.
